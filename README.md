# Texas Tech Citibus Route Finder

```diff

```

Welcome to our Citi Bus Route Finder Application based on Answer Set Prolog (ASP). This innovative application is designed to help students at Texas Tech University find the best and most efficient bus routes to their desired destinations inside this vast campus. With ASP, our application can help find the most optimal route based on the user’s inputs, including the bus stops and preferred routes.

**Problem Description:**
Texas Tech University is one of the biggest universities in the US geographically,” based on this statement we can assume how difficult it will be for the new students to commute inside the campus. Additionally, there are many buses that operate on many routes both inside and outside the cam- pus. This adds up more burden to the new students to select the bus and the route to reach their classes on time. Moreover, the duration between classes is short and students must rush toward their classes. The students also have to face difficulties in choosing the bus route that takes them to their respective student housing apartments which are located outside of the campus.

**The Citibus Route Finder** is a project to create an intelligent agent web based application for the course CS-5368 - Intelligent System created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The backend of the app is created using SPARC programming language and hosted on GitHub.
